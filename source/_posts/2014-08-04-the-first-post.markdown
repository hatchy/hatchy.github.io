This is the standard first post!
I'm in Zambia at the moment so, hopefully I'll be able to get some good content into this blog soon and you won't be reading this in 2018 and this is still the only post!
I'll blog about whatever is relevant to me at the time.

Probably worth mentioning the pages that were helpful when creating this blog (This far atleast!).
Look down!
